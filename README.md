## Introduction to the problem
You are a new investor with X amount of dollars to invest but you are not too familiar with the stock
market. You don’t want to lose all your money and you are not risk-averse to the point that you are
better off opening a high saving account or investing in mutual funds only. You can do research to find
which stocks would be a good investment, but you notice stock prices fluctuate every day due to
demand and supply. That volatility affects our state of mind, provoking impulsive buying or selling. This
means you need to constantly keep track of current trends and news for each company which can be
difficult. Knowing what to pick can be tricky? How do we do it :
* Users pick a set of stocks and the AI identifies how much to invest in each stock by:
* Identifying the constraints while maximizing the value of our portfolio in a timely
manner
* Using the current sentiment based on social media and news chatter to assign a weight
to the stocks in the portfolio
* Using historic data to predict trends in interested stocks contributes towards analyzing
the risk vs return potential. (e.g. is the stock doing better/worse over time?)
We want our AI to assign the weights to each stock in our portfolio to find the optimal balance for risk
vs return. These weights are highly dependent on positive and negative news/trends in the media as
historic data is not representative of future outcomes. Our goal is to maximize the confidence in the
future return of our portfolio. E.g. Double our investment the fastest.

## The motivation for the problem
Identifying future prospects of a company is hard to grasp from past endeavors only. The earliest signs
come in the form of chatter in the media and amongst individuals. As students in our early 20’s, we can
leverage the power of compounding. Though, investing in the stock market can be very intimidating for
younger individuals just starting their careers. We are looking for assurance that the money we invest
will be able to grow over the years.
